## About me

Hello! I am a 5th year computer science student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
in Stockholm, Sweden. 

I enjoy many things, including video games, reading, music, photography, and programming. 
Below, you'll find a collection of links to projects I've worked on, and "finished," to some degree. They're mostly school projects.

Feel free to check out my GitHub for a peek at some of the ideas I haven't found as much time for!

## Recent projects (Since starting my master's programme)

### [CoVRt](https://druskus20.github.io/covrt-web)
<!--<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>-->

As part of a course on advanced graphics and interaction, a 2-player asymmetrical VR+desktop computer game was developed. My responsibilities included programming of visual effects for the desktop player, and a 3D fractal the VR player can explore in first person. I learned about raymarching and screenspace transformations, as well as some of the intricacies of working with VR in Unity.

As part of a course on computer graphics and interaction, I implemented a stylized real-time raytracing solution for voxel scenes with per-voxel lighting. I learnt a lot about gpu programming and efficient traversal of uniform grids, and it was a lot of fun to implement a unique lighting system with reflecitons.

### [Fisher-Man](https://urchin-game.github.io/)
<!--<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>-->

An indie game was proposed and a small vertical slice of it was implemented as part of a course on game design. I implemented swinging physics for the grappling hook, and applied the wave function collapse algorithm for procedural generation of levels. I learnt a lot about communication and structuring and documentation of a game project.
